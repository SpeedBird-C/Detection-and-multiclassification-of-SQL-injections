# Detection-and-multiclassification-of-SQL-injections
SQL-injection detection and multiclassification

The Task was to create an IDS via machine learning to detect

* blacklisted operands of sql-injection
* blind boolean based
* blind time based
* error based
* double query
Metrics for each class are:

* Precision
* Recall
* F1-scrore (and support)
* Multiclassification metrics are

Confusion matrix
* ROC-cruve
* Accuracy
* Micro Precision
* Micro Recall
* Micro F1-score
* Macro Precision
* Macro Recall
* Macro F1-score
* Weighted Precision
* Weighted Recall
* Weighted F1-score
